# Alfido Tech Data Analytics Internship

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository documenting my Data Analytics internship at Alfido Tech. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on three distinct projects that allowed me to showcase my skills in data exploration, visualization, and analysis.

## Project Overview

### 1. Weather Data Analysis
For the Weather Data Analysis project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of various weather conditions and meterological data. This included plotting different weather parameters, comparing features, calculating averages, and performing correlation analysis. This task demonstrated my proficiency in data exploration and visualization.

### 2. Uber Data Analysis
The Uber Data Analysis project involved in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization. I utilized 3D pie charts and graphs to represent category and purpose distribution, compared them, and clustered start and stop places based on distance. Additionally, I determined the frequency of each phase with a specific purpose, showcasing my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

### 3. Inventory Analysis
In the Inventory Analysis project, I focused on data cleaning and analysis of vendor information, product sizes, and classifications. Visualization techniques were employed to identify the top 10 vendors based on sales volume. I also conducted cluster analysis using k-means based on size, volume, and price, presenting the results through 3D plots, pair plots, and radar charts.

## Key Achievements

- Proficiently conducted data exploration and visualization in the context of weather conditions, Uber data, and inventory information.
- Demonstrated strong analytical skills through feature comparison, correlation analysis, and clustering techniques.
- Utilized advanced visualization tools, including 3D pie charts, graphs, 3D plots, pair plots, and radar charts, to present meaningful insights.
- Successfully cleaned and analyzed diverse datasets, showcasing adaptability in handling various data types.

## Conclusion

This internship at Alfido Tech has not only allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical setting but also provided an opportunity to enhance my skills in data analytics. The projects undertaken have been intellectually stimulating in data analytics.

Thank you for considering my contributions during this internship. I look forward to discussing my experiences and insights further.

Best Regards,
